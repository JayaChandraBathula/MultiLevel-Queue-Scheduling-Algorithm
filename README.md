# MultiLevel-Queue-Scheduling-Algorithm

Multilevel Queue Scheduling process is replicated by considering the Priority, waiting time and burst time of each process and the resulting Gant Chart is generated along with average waiting time and completion time. The entire algorithm is designed in Java programming language with the FCFS algorithm in one queue and Round Robin in another queue.
